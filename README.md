How To Play:

Again! The aliens from Bomb Planet is invading our planet! We are having a tough fight with them on a satellite. We need to call for support from our mother planet. To do that we need to fix our four antennas. Walk around in our satellite and you will see four pillars. Those are our antennas! Climb up to the very top and stay for 10 seconds, and then you will successfully repair the antenna. When you repair 4 antennas, you have fullfilled your duty! Remeber to dodge the boms or shoot them. You will take damage if they explode close to you. Note that during your repairation of the antenna, you can barely move, so that is when you are in most danger.

Note: there seems to be some bug about the normals of the meshes. So at the begining of the game you need to move backward first (by pressing *"S"*).
